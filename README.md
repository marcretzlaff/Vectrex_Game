# Vectrex Game - Silver Surfer: Surfing through time 

Developing of a game for the Vectrex console from 1982. 
Sidescroller where the comic-figur silver surfer tries to navigate through obstacles.
Uses Floppy Bird physics, so the only control for now will be to jump upwards.

## Getting Started

The game is part of my studies.

### Prerequisites

For running the finished game you need an emulator or the orginal console :)


## Built With

* [Geany] - Editor used
* [ParaJVE] - emulator to test
